# [PYTHON] Titanic Survival Prediction
# Introduction
- This project is inspired by the Kaggle challenge "Machine Learning From Disaster".
- Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data
- I implemented the solution using sklearn for machine learning, including custom code for train-test splitting and preprocessing.
- Aimed at beginners in AI, especially those interested in machine learning.

# Warning
- This is my first project when I learned machine learning, and there may be some deficiencies.


# Conclusion
- Thank you for taking the time to explore my project. I appreciate any feedback or suggestions for improvement.
